# Quantum Computing

## What is a quantum computer?
- it's a computer build up from qubits (quantum bits)
- like a classic computer that are build up from classical bits

### Whats a bit and qbit?
- bit: 0 or 1
- qbit: 0, 1, both
	- 2 characriristics of quantum: superposition & entanglement

#### Superposition
- it's anything it could be
- don't pick anything until the observation
- ex container that contains a beverage. In superposition it could contain all of those until we pick a specific beverage

#### Entanglement
- if 2 qbits are entangled, a change in 1 qubit cause a change in another qbit (instantaneously) 
- from Einstein: Spooky Actioon at Distance (not faster than the speed of light)

### Classical vs quantum'
Classical

$$2 * n_bits$$

Quantum

$$2^n_qbits$$
